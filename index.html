      <img class="imageofpoverty" src="images/pexels-riya-kumari-874684.jpg" width="500px" height="400px">
    <p class="povertytext">Poverty has been defined by many countries with income level of deprivation level, but literally in real sense poverty is the level at which human beings will not be able to survive. When it clutches in hardship then it become impossible to proceed in life. Darkness prevails around the eyes, when there remains no coin in the pocket. It turns someone into inhuman activities. Or sometime poor people divert them from mainstream of a country and works against the law and order. But simple people found them clutches themselves in the vicious circle of poverty till death</p>

          <p class="povertytext">Corruption perpetuates poverty. It skews decisions and diverts scarce funds, denying poor people
            access to basic social services and resources to improve their livelihoods. Where better-off people
            can find private solutions to public failures - water filtration, generators, private schools and
            hospitals - disadvantaged groups have no alternative. For them, corruption creates a vicious cycle.
            If poor people can't speak up for their rights and demand accountability from their leaders, their
            needs aren't met and they can't escape poverty</p>
